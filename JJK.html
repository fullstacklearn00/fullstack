            <h3>About Gojo Satoru</h3>
            <p>Gojo Satoru is a character from the manga and anime series "Jujutsu Kaisen". He is a powerful sorcerer and a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Gojo is known for his laid-back personality, immense strength, and his signature blindfold. He is one of the most skilled and respected sorcerers in the series.</p>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>Appearance
Satoru is a very tall, lean, and muscular man in his late twenties who is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru usually covers his eyes with a black blindfold, which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. Satoru wears sunglasses and lets his hair down to the base of his neck when sporting a casual look.

While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar, which is also fairly broad. He wears matching slim-fit black pants and black dress boots. Before switching over to a simple blindfold, Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing[6] and has several casual looks he pairs with wearing his sunglasses. As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the standard school uniform with his sunglasses before adopting any makeshift blindfold.

During the Shinjuku Showdown Arc, Gojo didn’t wear his blindfold, letting his hair fall and eyes shown. He wore a tight-fitting black shirt, white baggy training pants with a black belt weaved through the waist, and black martial arts slippers, similar to Toji Fushiguro’s attire.</p>

<p>Personality
Satoru is a complex individual. He is usually laidback and playful with his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, as seen in his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji and his enemies.

"Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am the honored one
"Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am the honored one."

Satoru is overconfident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only goes as far as his judgment of their strength, and he is rather apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his desire for power, Gojo is very arrogant. He believes himself to be the strongest in the world, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout heaven and earth, [he] alone is the honored one." It is evident during his task of protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, his regret for her death was negated by his extensive pride and arrogance after learning reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro.[7]

During intense battles, Satoru occasionally falls into a manic fighting state, urged by his determination for victory and undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative style is characterized by his aggressive and domineering attacks while flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. Furthermore, in a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. He will prioritize his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he believes that the sacrifice is unavoidable. However, this only extends to the people killed by his opponent; he will not do any lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand.[8]

Nevertheless, despite his arrogance and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that although his recent conceited victory temporarily clouded his feelings, he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members who were clapping over Riko's death before being stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — from taking any action.[9] Furthermore, Satoru was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his "one and only" best friend, had become a murderous curse user. Satoru attempted to reason with his friend but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal.[10] After having to put an end to Suguru's life before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya. He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died.

Satoru's dream and endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom up through education. He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.[11]</p>
